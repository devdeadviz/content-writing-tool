# Content Writing Tool
**Architecture, State Management, and Accessibility Documentation**

---

## 1. Architecture Decisions

### 1.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vite + React (with TypeScript)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast builds and hot-reloads
- **Linting**: ESLint configured for code consistency

### 1.2 Project Structure
```plaintext
src/
  ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
  ├── hooks/         # Custom hooks (if needed)
  ├── pages/         # Different page components
  ├── utils/         # Helper functions/utilities
  ├── services/      # API and business logic layer
  └── App.tsx        # Root application component
```
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and utilities are kept modular.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component or function does one specific thing.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript enforces types across the project for reliability.

### 1.3 Configuration
- **Vite** (`vite.config.ts`): Optimized for fast bundling and dev server setup.
- **TailwindCSS**: Configured for responsive, utility-first styling.

## 2. State Management Approach

### 2.1 Local State (React Hooks)
- Managed primarily with **`useState`** and **`useReducer`**.
- Local states handle:
  - Text input fields
  - Form validation errors
  - UI toggles (modals, tabs)

### 2.2 Global/Shared State
- **Context API** is used if/when shared state is needed (not large enough yet for Redux or Zustand).
- Potential shared contexts:
  - EditorContext (current document state)

### 2.3 Server State Management
- No external server-state management (like React Query) yet — assumed static or client-side driven.
- If API integrations are added in future, **Tanstack Query** can be easily adopted.

### 2.4 Forms
- Lightweight form handling through native React (`onChange`, `onSubmit`).
- For scalability, could integrate **React Hook Form** later.

## 3. Accessibility (a11y) Considerations

### 3.1 Semantic HTML
- Proper semantic elements (`<button>`, `<form>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`) used wherever possible.
- Inputs are associated with labels for clarity.

### 3.2 Keyboard Accessibility
- All interactive elements (e.g., buttons, inputs) are fully navigable by keyboard (`Tab`, `Enter`).
- Focus outlines are visible (native or Tailwind customized).

### 3.3 ARIA Attributes
- Important for dynamic UI parts:
  - Use `aria-live="polite"` for live content updates.
  - `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` for better screen reader support (where needed).

### 3.4 Color Contrast
- Tailwind classes maintain high color contrast.
- Ensures compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standard.

### 3.5 Responsive and Adaptive Design
- Tailwind’s mobile-first breakpoints used (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
- The UI adapts across device types (phones, tablets, desktops).

## 4. Future Enhancements

| Area | Plan |
|:----|:----|
| API Integration | Introduce server state management (React Query) |
| Form Management | Add React Hook Form for scalable forms |
| Accessibility | Add Lighthouse CI checks |
| Testing | Integrate unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library |
| Storybook | Setup Storybook for isolated UI component development |
| SEO | Add meta tags and Open Graph tags for better SEO |

# Conclusion
The project follows a **modern, modular, scalable** architecture that can easily grow.  
It emphasizes **developer experience**, **performance**, and **basic accessibility**, with room for **progressive enhancements** as the product matures.
